<p>Compilation of North Dakota linear surface water features. The primary usage of this dataset will be for cartographic representation on paper maps and internet map displays. Hydrologic analysis using this dataset would be inappropriate and those seeking data for this purpose should seek out data such as the National Hydrographic Dataset produced by the US Geological Survey.</p>
