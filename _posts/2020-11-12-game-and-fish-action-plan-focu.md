<p>This data layer depicts North Dakota Game and Fish Department Wildlife Action Plan focus areas. Focus Areas typically exhibit unique or easily identifiable differences in vegetation, soils, topography, hydrology or land use. Focus Areas are highly variable in size and often represent an area of native vegetation or a natural community type rare to North Dakota. Most of the 100 Species of Conservation Priority can be linked to Focus Areas.</p>
<p>The purpose of the data is to provide a comprehensive list and spatial location of North Dakota wildlife action plan focus areas. This dataset is primarily used as a framework data layer for use in GIS and other mapping applications and does not represent a land survey of the focus areas.</p>
