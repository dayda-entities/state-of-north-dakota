<p>Shows centers of public land survey system sections in North Dakota. This layer would be used primarily to label sections for cartographic reasons, allowing the section numbers to be consistently placed at the center of the section rather than labeling polygons and having the section number placed in random locations within the polygon.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong> Not to be used for navigation, for informational purposes only. See <a href="/north-dakota-disclaimer">full disclaimer</a> for more information</p>
