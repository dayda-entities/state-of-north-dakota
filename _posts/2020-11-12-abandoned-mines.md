<p>This feature class was developed from historic mine maps that were scanned and georeferenced. Additional mine locations were derived from NDGS Biennial Reports (1902 and 1912), the USGS GeoCommunicator web site (National Mine Land Inventory layer), and USGS 7.5 Minute Quadrangles. Portions of the mine locations are not verified and portions of the mines may be the same mine but operated under a different name during different time periods. Metadata was not available for the data from the USGS GeoCommunicator web site and mine locations from this USGS data set appear to have significant variability compared to known mine site locations.</p>
