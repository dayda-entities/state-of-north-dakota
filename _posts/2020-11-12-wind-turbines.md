<p>The wind turbine locations in this dataset are sourced weekly from the Federal Aviation Administration's Daily Digital Obstacle File (DDOF) which contains only obstruction data for those man-made objects that affect domestic aeronautical charting products and does not purport to indicate the presence of all obstructions that may be encountered. It is highly suggested to visit <a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dailydof/">http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dail...</a> to learn more about this data. The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is used as the horizontal datum for all DDOF data. All obstacle data has been converted to WGS 84 as of November 19, 2007.</p>
