<p>Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined. Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.</p>
