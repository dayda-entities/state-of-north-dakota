<p>Corners of 1:24000 USGS quadrangles. Each corner has been generated using a mathematical formula and is therefore theoretically perfect. The tic ID is a unique number identifying the corners of every 7.5' USGS Quadrangle in the state. It consists of the concatonation of the longitude degrees and minutes and the latitude degrees and minutes. For example, a point located at longitude of 97 degrees, 37 minutes, and 30 seconds, latitude of 45 degrees, 15 minutes, 0 seconds would have an ID of 97374515. Using this system, each corner in the state has a unique ID and consequently can be used in registering images or digitized paper maps.</p>
