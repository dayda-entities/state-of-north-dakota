<p>Summary of the major glacial-drift aquifers which are considered to have the greatest potential for yielding significant quantities of water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes. They underlie an area of about 8,900 square miles. It is estimated that about 66 million acre-feet of water is stored in these aquifers. As a comparison, Lake Sakakawea behind Garrison Dam contains approximately 24 million acre-feet of water when full.</p>
