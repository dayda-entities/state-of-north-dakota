<p>North Dakota statewide K-12 school location points. The dataset was updated in April 2018 and represents a snapshot of the K-12 school locations for the 2017-2018 school year. The dataset geometry was derived from the latitude and longitude coordinates of each school, but a majority of the points were adjusted and moved on top of the school buildings using aerial imagery as a reference. Esri's 2018 aerial imagery was used along with Google Maps to determine the locations of the school buildings. A scale of 1:2,400 was used as a reference when placing points on top of the school buildings.</p>
