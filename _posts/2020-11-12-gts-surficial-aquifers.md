<p>This data was used for prioritizing aquifers in the Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality aquifer monitoring program; specifically targeting aquifers that have a high potential for pesticide contamination. This data was developed from surficial aquifers mapped as of 1997 and represents a snapshot in time. This data contains pesticide drastic scores, chemical use surrogate scores, permitted water volumes, UIC Drastic scores, and total monitoring scores as referenced in the online report, 'Geographic Targeting System for Groundwater Monitoring' published in 1997 by the then NDDoH.  *Note Senate Bill 2327 passed in 2017 split off the Environmental Health Section from the NDDoH and became an independent agency, NDDEQ.</p>
