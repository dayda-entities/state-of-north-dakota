<p>This dataset contains the lakes and reservoirs that have been assessed and categorized by Department of Environmental Quality-Division of Water Quality for the 2018 Integrated Report submitted to and approved by the US EPA. The lakes are a subset and enhancement of the 1:100,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). NDDEQ-WQ adds additional lakes or modifies outlines to reflect current conditions based on the most recent aerial imagery. Since the assessed and categorized lakes are a subset of the NHD lakes, only that subset is included in this dataset. Updated August, 2019.</p>
